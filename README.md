# Arduino Project 4 – Dimmable LED with Potentiometer 🔆

This project demonstrates how to control the **brightness of an LED** using a potentiometer connected to an Arduino.  
It introduces the concept of **analog input** and **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** for analog-like output.

## 🛠️ What I Learnt
- How to read analog input with `analogRead()`  
- Using `analogWrite()` to control LED brightness  
- Basics of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)  

## 🔌 Components Used
- 1 x Arduino board
- 1 x LED  
- 1 x 220Ω resistor  
- 1 x 10kΩ potentiometer  
- Breadboard + jumper wires
